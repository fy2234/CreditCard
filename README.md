# CreditCard
The dataset that I am going to analyze is about credit risk. The dataset is found from UCL Machine Learning Repository. This dataset has 30,000 records and 24 variables. 
X1 is the amount of the given credit of both the individual and his/her family.
X2 is the gender of the client. (1 = male; 2 = female)
X3 is the education level of the client. (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others) X4 is the martial status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others)
X5 is the age. 
X6 to X11 tracked the past monthly payment records. (-1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above) X6 is the repayment status in September, 2005. X7 is the repayment status in August, 200;â€¦;X11 which is the repayment status in April, 2005. 
X12 to X17 is the amount of bill statement. X12 is the amount of bill statement in September, 2005. X13 is the amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 is the amount of bill statement in April, 2005. 
X18 to X23 is the amount of previous payment. X18 is the amount paid in September, 2005; X19 is the amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 is the amount paid in April, 2005. Y is whether the client has payment default next month. (Yes = 1, No = 0)
My goal is to train a model to predict the default status of clients next month. This is a classification problem.
